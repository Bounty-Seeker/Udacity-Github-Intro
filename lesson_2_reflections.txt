git init creates revelant files to start tracking the repository.
The staging area gives me much greater control over which parts of my working directory is commited.
Using git diff, git diff --staged and the staging area alow me to track what is to be updated then update.
Branches allow code to be altered and adapted in different logical directions without interfering with each other.
Visual representations of the branches allows me to easily see the progress and difeerences between branches.
Merging two branches takes the two branches and makes a new commit where changed due to each branch or combined. This is simply represented by two branches becoming one.
Git automatically merges files when their are zero outstanding conflicts. This means it makes less errors which corrupt files.
